# LuxCoreDeps - The LuxCore Dependency Provider

## About

**LuxCoreDeps provides the dependencies required to build LuxCore, starting with
version 2.10.**

LuxCoreDeps is based on Conan dependency manager (https://conan.io/). It builds dependency
sets for the following 4 platforms:
- Linux
- Windows x86_64
- Windows ARM64
- MacOS x86_64
- MacOS ARM64

## How does it work?

### On provider side (LuxCoreDeps)
LuxCoreDeps populates a Conan cache, by building & installing all the
dependencies required to build LuxCore.
Dependencies encompass binaries, headers, build profiles, metadata...

Once populated, the cache is bundled (`conan cache save`) and published
in a Github release.

### On consumer side (LuxCore)
In LuxCore, the provided cache is downloaded from the LuxCoreDeps release
and restored locally (`conan cache restore`), thus making all the dependencies
available for LuxCore build.
In LuxCore, the download and restoration of the cache are wrapped in a convenient
`make deps` statement.

  end

```



## Building & Publishing LuxCore Dependencies

_(For admin only - requires appropriate rights on repository)_

Dependencies are built from sources, thanks to Conan recipes. Building from
sources provides the following benefits:
- The binary compatibility (compiler version, GLIBC version etc.) can be controlled
  in a fine-grained manner. Which, in particular, is required for Python wheel.
- The options of each dependency can be selected precisely.
- The build options (SSE, AVX, compiler optimizations...) can also be selected
  in fine detail.
- Dependency source code can be debugged if needed, as deps can be compiled
  with debug information if needed (yes, dependencies sometimes contain bugs...)
- Dependency source code can be patched if needed.

LuxCoreDeps is exclusively intended to be run in continuous integration by
Github Actions. Other builds may exist, in local machines, but they should be
restricted to debugging.

To trigger dependency build & publish, use **LuxCore Dependency Releaser** action,
with `Run workflow` button:
https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/LuxCoreDeps/actions/workflows/release.yml. This
action will build the dependency package and publish it in a release. Please follow
semantic versioning when doing so.

Once built, dependencies are made available to LuxCore via LuxCoreDeps
**releases**: https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/LuxCoreDeps/releases

Note that, for debugging purpose, dependency build is also triggered by
`push` events; however, in that case, no release is created.



## Adding or Upgrading Dependencies in LuxCoreDeps

_(For admin only - requires appropriate rights on repository)_

Dependencies can be added or upgraded in LuxCoreDeps by upgrading the `conanfile.py`
file, located in the repository root.

Please refer to Conan documentation for syntax of `conanfile.py` and instructions
how to modify such a file.


## Tips & Caveats

### Where to start - LuxCoreDeps entry points
The main entry point is `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
Other interesting files may be:
- `run-conan.sh`: the bash script that invokes Conan
- `conanfile.py`: Conan script to build dependencies
- `conan-profiles`: folder with Conan profiles

### Versioning rules
LuxCoreDeps follows Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org).

### Compilation environment
For Python wheels to be built properly, it is essential that dependencies be built
by `CIBUILDWHEEL`, with the same environment (compiler version, manylinux container,
etc.) as the one intended for the wheels. This is especially true for Linux build, which
must occur in a manylinux container. See https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/ for more details.

### Local recipes
Most of Conan recipes used by LuxCoreDeps are to be found in Conan central repository (Conan center).
However, a few ones did not exist on-the-shelf and were created as local recipes: see `local-conan-recipes` folder.

### Debugging
Dependency build can be debugged locally using `nektos/act`
(https://github.com/nektos/act).

`utils/CI-local-build.sh` contains a working example of `act`invokation under Linux.
